# `Sista`

`Sista` is a *lightweight*, *fast*, *easy-to-use* and *OS-agnostic* *object-oriented* library for making terminal videogames in `C++`.

`Sista` provides a set of classes and functions to make terminal games in `C++` easier, shielding developers from having to reinvent the wheel every time they want to make a terminal videogame.

## Installation

To install Sista, simply download the latest release from [`GitHub`](https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Sista/releases), and extract the contents of the archive to your project's source directory.

## Usage

To use Sista, simply include the `"sista.hpp"` header in your project's source files.

```cpp

#include "include/sista/sista.hpp"

```

The `"sista.hpp"` header includes all of the other headers in the `"include/sista/"` directory, so you don't have to include them individually.

## Documentation

The english documentation for Sista can be found at [`Sista - ReadTheDocs`](https://sista.readthedocs.io/).

Additional information about versions can be found in the [`Release Notes`](ReleaseNotes.md).
