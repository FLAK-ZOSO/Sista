``Sista`` is a *lightweight*, *fast*, and *easy-to-use* *OOP* library for making terminal games in ``C++``.

``Sista`` provides a set of classes and functions to make terminal games in ``C++`` easier.

Inspired by their `Forsiktig <https://github.com/Lioydiano/Forsiktig>`_ 's `variables.hpp <https://github.com/Lioydiano/Forsiktig/blob/main/variables.hpp>`_ header, `FLAK-ZOSO <https://flak-zoso.github.io>`_ decided to make a library to prevent others from having to reinvent the wheel every time they wanted to make a terminal game.

``OS Compatibility``
----------------------

Sista is cross-platform and should work on any terminal that supports ANSI escape codes.

``Installation``
-------------

To install Sista, simply download the latest release from `GitHub <https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Sista>`_.
Extract the contents of the archive to your project's source directory.

``Usage``
-------------

To use Sista, simply include the ``"sista.hpp"`` header in your project's source files.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "include/sista/sista.hpp"


The ``"sista.hpp"`` header includes all of the other headers in the ``"include/sista/"`` directory, so you don't have to include them individually.

``Documentation``
--------------

Some of the documentation for Sista can be found in the `Release Notes <https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Sista/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md>`_ and `Benchmarks <https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Sista/blob/main/Benchmarks.md>`_ files.

The rest of the documentation can be found on Read the Docs: `Sista Documentation <https://sista.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

``Introduction``
----------------

I provided a simple example of how to use Sista to make a terminal animation in `sista.cpp <https://github.com/FLAK-ZOSO/Sista/blob/main/sista.cpp>`_.

I will provide a more detailed explaination of the Sista example in the `intro <intro.html>`_.
